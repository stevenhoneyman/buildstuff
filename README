buildstuff
==========

NOTE: UNDER DEVELOPMENT - MAY NOT WORK!

A script that... builds... stuff!

This was originally a script to download and compile musl libc and busybox from their upstream git source code, but is becoming closer to an initramfs based mini-distro (at which point the name will change).

Notes
-----

- CONFIG=1 allows gconfig of busybox


TODO
----

- Rewrite the download function
- Make it more easily configurable
- X?
- gcc shared/musl static choice
