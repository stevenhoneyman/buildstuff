buildstuff
==========

A script that... builds... stuff!

I don't know what this will end up as yet, but it started life as a script to download and compile musl libc and busybox from their upstream git source code.

An initramfs mini-distro could be a possibility.

Notes
-----

- If your prefix is a symlink e.g. /musl then NODIRCHECK=1 skips the check
- CONFIG=1 allows gconfig of busybox


TODO
----

- Rewrite the download function
- Make it more easily configurable
